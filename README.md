# simple_task_manager -  Console Task Manager
### What it can do?
It is a simple app, that can save your tasks. You can choose a priority to your task.

All task are sorted by priority, and if you will choose method **do_current_task()**, 
it will delete task with the highest priority *(the lowest number)* and lowest deadline or if it's empty? the lowest date.

### Why did I do this?
I want to practise with framework **hibernate** and test my skills 

It isn't perfect app, because it has not some update methods, but for training... Why not?)
